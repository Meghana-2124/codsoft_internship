# 🎮 Task 2 – Tic-Tac-Toe AI (Unbeatable Bot)

This is an unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe AI built using Python and the Minimax algorithm, submitted as part of the **CODSOFT Artificial Intelligence Internship**.

The AI competes against a human player in a 3x3 grid and ensures optimal moves every time using game theory logic.

## 📌 Features

- Play against an unbeatable AI 🤖
- Human selects `X` or `O`
- Command-line interface (CLI) based game
- Detects win, lose, or draw
- Implements **Minimax Algorithm**
- No external libraries used (pure Python)

## 🧠 AI Algorithm Used

### Minimax
The AI explores all possible moves using a recursive **Minimax** strategy. It evaluates each board state and chooses the move that maximizes the AI's chances of winning while minimizing the human's.
